# Spell with Me
###### Spell with me is an app that teachers can use to differentiate the learning of spelling words for students. Instead of issuing one list to the whole class, they can individualize the list for each student to match that student's reading comprehension level. I originally came up with the idea for this app when my 2nd grader came home with a spelling word list and I realized that there were no apps out there to help me organize her words and keep them so that she can study them consistently.

## The Trello Board for this project can be found [here.](https://trello.com/invite/b/66c5e9554e4f43168dc7e434/ATTId88f798602c93421b49faf41d9c8a22c31478773/spell-with-me-project)

## The technologies used in this app were 
* Python
* Django
* SQL
* CSS
* HTML

### The next steps for this app are to make it more functional for teachers and even parents to use. I also want to add a way for students to log into their account and play games to practice their words.
